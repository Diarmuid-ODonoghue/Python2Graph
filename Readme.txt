This is all the code used in my project. To run this code you will need to install python. The files "Maps2Graphs", "DFS" and "isomorphvf2CB" were not developed by me.

Everything else was written by me and to run this code you will need to install certain librarys
these are:

 1.networkx
 2.pandas
 3.matplotlib

The rest of the librarys used are built into python. You will also need to make sure in the code that you change all the directory locations.
